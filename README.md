# Simple-Neural-Network

First Neural Network!  It's extremely simple, with no hidden layers, only 3 inputs, and only 2 outputs.
It uses a sigmoid activation function and weights are inititialized completely randomly.  There are no biases.
It takes in an input of array of 3 numbers and outputs a number based on the input.
